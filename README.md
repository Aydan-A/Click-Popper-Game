Pop Game  
Pop Game is a fun and interactive browser-based game where players need to click on randomly appearing "pop" elements. Each pop displays a unique icon and value, and the player's goal is to accumulate points and avoid running out of lives. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


How to Play  
Start the Game: Click the buttons to reveal the icons and values of the grid elements. You begin with 3 lives.  
Gain or Lose Points: The score will change based on the value of the clicked elements.  
If the element has a positive value, your score increases.  
If the element has a negative value, your score decreases.  
Lose Lives: If your score goes below zero, you lose one life. The game ends when you have no lives left.  
Game Over: The game will display a "Game Over" message when you run out of lives, and the game restarts.
