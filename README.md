Pop Game is a fun and interactive browser-based game where players need to click on randomly appearing "pop" elements.   
Each pop displays a unique icon and value, and the player's goal is to accumulate points and avoid running out of lives. 
The game is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Game Mechanics

Score: Clicking on an active pop will add points to your score based on the value of the pop.  
Lives: You start with 3 lives. Each time your score falls to zero or below, you lose a life. When you run out of lives, the game ends.  
Pops: The pops appear randomly and will disappear after a short time if not clicked.  
Game Over: When your lives reach zero, the game ends and displays "Game Over".
