Pop Game  
Pop Game is a fun and interactive browser-based game where players need to click on randomly appearing "pop" elements. Each pop displays a unique icon and value, and the player's goal is to accumulate points and avoid running out of lives. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Game Mechanics  
• Score: Clicking on an active pop will add points to your score based on the value of the pop.  
• Lives: You start with 3 lives. Every time your score falls to zero or below, you lose a life. When all lives are lost, the game ends.  
• Pops: Pops appear randomly on the screen and will disappear after a short time if not clicked. Be quick!  
• Game Over: When your lives reach zero, the game ends and displays a "Game Over" message.
